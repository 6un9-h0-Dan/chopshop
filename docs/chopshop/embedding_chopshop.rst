Embedding ChopShop
==================

Starting with ChopShop 3.0 it is possible to embed the core of ChopShop
aka, ChopLib into other python programs. Before going into how to do
this, here's a quick overview of the design.

ChopShop, which refers to the overall project (and not the specific
program 'chopshop') consists of disjointed pieces of code to accomplish
its goals. The chopshop program leverages these pieces to present to the
user the ability to analyze traffic more easily than would be done using
manual processes. The chopshop program has three pieces, specifically
consisting of the core library (ChopLib), a user interface (the chopshop
program itself) and a presentation layer (the ChopUi). The library and
the ui are then tied together using an interprocess message queue to
pass messages.

Before getting into each of the three pieces, let's discuss that
interprocess message queue that was mentioned above. The queue is a one
way queue that is meant to send data from the library to whatever
element on the other side is being used for presentation. In chopshop,
for example, ChopUi is consuming the queue.

There are two high-level types of messages that are sent across the
queue, 'Control' messages and 'Data' messages. All messages are python
data objects. Control messages have the following structure:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   ctrl_message = { 'type' : 'ctrl',
                    'data' : { 'msg': 'X',
                                other dependant on 'X'}
                  }

       if 'X' == 'finished':
           'status': 'ok' | 'error'
       if 'X' == 'addmod':
           'name': "module name"
           'id'  : "module id"
       if 'X' == 'stop':
           no other elements
   </pre>

Data messages have the following format:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   message = { 'type'   : 'txt'|'json'|'filedata'
               'module' : 'module name',
               'id'     : 'module id',
               'time'   : 'packet timestamp',
               'addr'   : (('src','srcprt'),('dst','dstprt')),
               'proto'  : 'tcp'|'udp',
               'data'   : {type dependant data dictionary}
             }


       if 'type' == 'txt':
           'data' = { 'data' : 'string data',
                      'suppress' : True|False -- suppress the \n at the end of the line
                      'color' : 'Requested Color'
                    }
       if 'type' == 'json':
           'data' = { 'data' : 'string of json data'}

       if 'type' == 'filedata':
           'data' = { 'data' : data to output,
                      'mode' : requested write mode (w|a),
                      'finalize': True|False -- whether this is the final write and the file should be closed
                    }
   </pre>

The 'type' and 'data' fields are the only consistent names across all of
messages and any usage of a message should at the least check the type
before using it.

So now that we've looked at the message format, let's look at all three
pieces and see how to embed them. We will be using the chopshop program
as an example.

ChopLib: ChopLib is the core of ChopShop, it does the actual handling of
the modules and all of the real work, if you want to embed ChopShop into
a program, this is more than likely what you'll want, at the least.

An instance of ChopLib is instantiated like any other python class:

.. code:: python

    # The following line assumes the chopshop package has been installed in
    # your system
    from chopshop.shop.ChopLib import ChopLib

    choplib = ChopLib()

ChopLib has the following options:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   mod_dir -- The directory to load modules from. Defaults to ChopShop's working
   directory + /modules. Should be set to an absolute path
   <default: CHOPSHOP_WD + '/modules/'>

   NEW: In ChopLib 4.1 mod_dir is now an array of strings. For backwards
   compatibility it will accept a string and auto-convert to an array

   ext_dir -- The directory to load external libraries from. Defaults to
   ChopShop's working directory + /ext_libs. Should be set to an absolute path
   <default: CHOPSHOP_WD + '/ext_libs/'>

   NEW: In ChopLib 4.1 ext_dir is now an array of strings. For backwards
   compatibility it will accept a string and auto-convert to an array

   base_dir -- The base directory to look for modules/ext_libs. This parameter
   takes precedence over mod_dir and ext_dir
   <default: None>

   NEW: In ChopLib 4.1 base_dir is now an array of strings. For backwards
   compatibility it will accept a string and auto-convert to an array

   filename -- Pcap file to use as input
   <default: ''>

   filelist -- List of Pcap files to use as input
   <default: None>

   bpf -- The BPF filter to send to nids
   <default: None>

   aslist -- Whether to treat 'filename' as a list of files to read in
   <default: False>

   longrun -- Reads from input forever even if there's no data to read, useful
   for reading from FIFO's
   <default: False>

   interface -- What interface to read from. This option has priority over
   reading from a file
   <default: ''>

   modinfo -- This instance of the ChopLib should only read the module_info and
   then exit
   <default: False>

   modtree -- This instance of ChopLib should output a tree of how modules would
   chain together and then exit
   <default: False>

   GMT -- Timestamps should be in GMT
   <default: False>

   savefiles -- If set to True, will enable ChopLib's saving of files
   <default: False>

   text -- If set to True, will enable ChopLib's hanlding of text data
   <default: False>

   jsonout -- If set to True, will enable ChopLib's handling of json data
   <default: False>

   modules -- The list of modules that is going to be processed. This is
   essentially what people type in at the commandline
   <default: ''>
   </pre>

ChopLib has the following functions that are useful for embedding:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   start() -- Kicks off ChopLib to start processing

   finish() -- Should be called to properly kill intra-communication
   channels

   join() -- Inherited from Thread, should be called to properly join
   </pre>

The above functions are the ones used by chopshop but other functions
are available depending on what functionality is desired:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   get_message_queue() -- returns the interprocess message queue that is
   used for output

   get_stop_fn() -- returns the stop function used to stop the Library

   version() -- returns the version of ChopLib

   setup_local_chop(name = "ChopShop", pid = -1) -- usually not needed
   but allows the calling program (e.g., chopshop) to get its own local 'chop' library
   </pre>

ChopUi:

ChopUi is a wrapper around other functions and classes. It is designed
to be overridable and simple. By default, ChopUi will use the output
handlers available in ChopUiStd for all functionality but all of those
handlers can be overriden by specifying an alternative object.

ChopUi has the following options:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   stdout - Set to True to enable handling of output to stdout, set to an
   Object to override the stdout handler.
   <default: False>

   gui - Set to True to enable hanlding of output to gui, set to an Object
   to override the gui handler.
   <default: False>

   fileout - Set to True to enable handling of text output to a file, set to an
   Object to override the handler.
   <default: False>

   filedir - Set to the format string to where the file should be saved
   <default: None>

   savefiles - Set to True to enable handling of file saving, set to an
   Object to override the handler.
   <default: False>

   savedir - Set to the format string as to where to save files
   <default: None>

   jsonout - Set to True to enable handling of json output data, set to an
   Object to override the handler.
   <default: False>

   jsondir - Set to a format string as to where to save json output data
   <default: None>
   </pre>

The following functions are useful when using ChopUi:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   start() - Kicks off the ui

   bind(ChopLib_Instance) - 'Binds' a ChopLib instance to this ui instance

   stop() - Stops the ui
   </pre>

A few other functions exist that shouldn't be needed for regular
operations:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   set_message_queue(message_queue) - Sets the message queue to be
   consumed from -- called by ChopUi.bind()

   set_library_stop_fn(lib_stop_fn) - Sets the library stop function --
   called by ChopUi.bind()
   </pre>

Putting it together, we create a program like chopshop. As the glue
chopshop has the following responsibilities:

-  Parse all command line arguments
-  Handle reading from stdin if necesary
-  Handle signals
-  Setting up options to the library and ui
-  Starting the ui and the library
-  Cleaning up properly

Overriding UI handlers: All Ui handlers need four functions to be
defined to be callable by ChopUi:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   Handler.__init__(ui_stop_fn, lib_stop_fn) -- This function will start up the
   handler, giving it functions to stop either the Ui or the Library if
   necessary. Most handlers will ignore those variables

   Handler.handle_message(message) -- This function is meant to handle the data
   messsage for the type it is. For example a stdout handler will only get 'txt'
   messages and should never get 'json' messages

   Handler.handle_ctrl(message) -- This function is meant to handle 'ctrl'
   messages

   Handler.stop() -- This function is called when ChopUi is ending and gives the
   handler a chance to shutdown properly
   </pre>

To override the handler, you simply need to assign the handler you want
to override with the object you want to replace it. For example:

.. code:: python

    from chopshop.shop.ChopUi import ChopUi
    chopui = ChopUi()
    chopui.stdout = MyAwesomeStdoutHandler

As long as that object 'MyAwesomeStdoutHandler' has the four required
functions, it will be used without issue to handle any 'txt' data. Please
look at the classes defined in shop/ChopUiStd.py as a reference for
creating your own overriding handlers.
